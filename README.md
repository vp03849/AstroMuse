# AstroMuse
Our program allows blind people to learn astronomy, to show how science can be learned and loved by everyone! We specifically use the constellation of Taurus, and display sounds of each stars according to its brightness level. In this project, we used react native and expo.io. In order to run, make sure you have npm and node installed on your system, and make sure to unzip the attatched zipped file.
